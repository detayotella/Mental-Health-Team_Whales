Student Mental Health Data Analysis Repositiory


Project Overview: 

This statistical research project aims to investigate the effects of mental health on students' CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average). The dataset included information on mental health issues, such as anxiety, depression and treament, as well as their prevalence among college students. The project graphically revealed the dataset by conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) as well as analyze the relationship between mental health and academic performance(CGPA), using statistical methods to determine if there is a significant correlation between mental health and CGPA. The findings of this study might provide valuable insights into the impact of mental health on students' academic success and may help inform policies and programs aimed at improving mental health support for college students. 
 
 


The main objective of this project was to conduct a Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Specifically, the project explored the following:
Basic descriptic statistics of the dataset
Distribution of the numerical columns using histograms
Distribution of the categorical columns using countplots
The relationship between the categorical columns using crosstab and stacked bar charts
The relationship between multiple variables using scatter plots
The distribution of the numerical columns using density plots
The relationship between the categorical and numerical columns using swarm plots
The effect of mental health on students' CGPA.
